Contains my i3 configuration, my statusline, and a simplified example statusline which demonstrates how to send JSON data to i3bar.
(Note, due to changes in the protocol, i3wm must be version 4.3 or newer for the statusline scripts to work)

More information about the json protocol for i3bar can be found here: http://build.i3wm.org/docs/i3bar-protocol.html
