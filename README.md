Contains my i3 configuration, my statusline, and a simplified example statusline which demonstrates how to send JSON data to i3bar.

Notes
- due to changes in the protocol, i3wm must be version 4.3 or newer for the statusline scripts to work)
- remember to change the interfaces line in 'statusline_evidlo' to the correct interface or you'll get an error

More information about the json protocol for i3bar can be found here: http://build.i3wm.org/docs/i3bar-protocol.html
